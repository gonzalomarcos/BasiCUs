# BasiCUs 

Basic use cases that I consider that should be enabled/deployed, we will consider the use cases based on the log sources too taking into account the volume of the logs generated by the technology and the easiness of deploying the use case. We will split the UCs based on the system. 

All these detection rules will try to look for common TTPs used by APTs.

Checked most used TTPs to create the BasiCUs
