# BasiCUs 

## Idea
The main idea of this project is deploying basic use cases that I consider that should be enabled/deployed in every SIEM. The rules have been considered based on the log sources, taking into account the volume of the logs generated by the source and the easiness of deploying the use case. We will split the UCs based on the system source. 

I have splited the UCs in the following environments:
- Core
  - Should be present across all systems
- Servers
  - Internet facing servers and internal servers
- Endpoints
  - Users endpoints
- DCs/AD
  - Uses cases based on domain controllers or common attacks to active directory
- ATMs
  - ATMs use cases

All these detection rules will try to look for common TTPs used by APTs. All the use cases will have a sigma link to check it's logic.
