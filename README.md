# BasiCUs 

## Idea
Basic use cases that I consider that should be enabled/deployed, we will consider the use cases based on the log sources too taking into account the volume of the logs generated by the technology and the easiness of deploying the use case. We will split the UCs based on the system. 

All these detection rules will try to look for common TTPs used by APTs. All the rules will have a link to check it's logic. 
Checked most used TTPs to create the BasiCUs

## Prioritization

I have prioritized one log sources over others in order to create the UCs. Also I have take into account that in the same log source it can be different volumes of events, for example, I have prioritized any windows events over process creation in case it was possible since the volume of the proccess creation logs is bigger.
